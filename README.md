# CreatePT2023
JetBrains Compose Desktop app for my AP CSP performance task.

## Why is this open-sourced?
While I was looking into other Create PT examples, I was unable to find one done in Kotlin. By studying myself, I wasn't following the code.org curriculum and therefore had no prior experience with the JS platform it used. Writing it in Kotlin was the only viable option, and I was able to get a 5 on the exam! I also learned that:
- Large amounts of code/clutter do NOT affect your score.
- Keep the video short and concise, however, feel free to add other features.

## Who is this for?
Younger Android developers, who may have a great amount of experience with Kotlin, feel free to write your Create PTs in Kotlin.
